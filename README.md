cChat
=====

cChat is a simple chat application I made using Java and JavaFX. I chose JavaFX over swing because of the flexibility of JavaFX. To use, simply download the already packaged jar file and run it using the latest update of Java 1.7 or newer. Two JOptionPanes prompt for the user name and the server address (server can be found [here] (github.com)). Use the textfield at the bottom of the window and chat away!
